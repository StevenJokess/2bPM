    "The global dairy farming industry loses $32 billion annually due to mastitis infections. At a minimum, twenty-five percent of cows each year are impacted regardless of how well managed a farm is. Farmers lack a way to quickly and easily identify mastitis at an early stage so they can take preventative measures to reduce the impact on yields.  With Labbyâ€™s solution, farmers and dairy processors finally have a way to quickly and easily test raw milk gaining visibility into animal health, milk quality, and feed efficiency, enabling them to optimize their operations."
