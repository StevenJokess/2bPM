Anarchist - Choose whatever you want to read, whenever you want to read
it. Imperialist - Proceed through all tutorials in order. In this
fashion you will be exposed to each model first from scratch, writing
all the code ourselves but for the basic linear algebra primitives and
automatic differentiation. Capitalist - If you don’t care how things
work (or already know) and just want to see working code in gluon, you
can skip (from scratch!) tutorials and go straight to the
production-like code using the high-level gluon front end.
