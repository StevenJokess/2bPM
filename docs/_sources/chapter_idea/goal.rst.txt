So as long we need to code, we failed that because 99.8% of the world
can’t code. The main goal would be to get to a point where it’s not a
library but a piece of software that doesn’t required code. It certainly
shouldn’t require a lenghty hardworking course like this one. I want to
get rid of the course, get rid of the code. I want to make it so you can
do usual stuff quickly and easily. That’s may be 5 years, may be longer.
