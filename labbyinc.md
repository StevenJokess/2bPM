Labby Inc, an early-stage startup specializing in AI-enabled optical sensing solutions for raw milk testing, today announced it has raised $480,000 in seed funding. AgriTech Capital, a strategy and investment firm specializing in innovation and technology in the agribusiness sector.



The global dairy farming industry loses $32 billion annually due to mastitis infections. At a minimum, twenty-five percent of cows each year are impacted regardless of how well managed a farm is. Farmers lack a way to quickly and easily identify mastitis at an early stage so they can take preventative measures to reduce the impact on yields.  With Labbyâ€™s solution, farmers and dairy processors finally have a way to quickly and easily test raw milk gaining visibility into animal health, milk quality, and feed efficiency, enabling them to optimize their operations.
